# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses four machine learning models—**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest**—to predict whether a person has a heart condition. It aims to identify the most accurate model based on real-world health indicators using a cleaned dataset.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following features:

1. **HeartDisease** – Whether the person ever had coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI)  
2. **BMI** – Body Mass Index  
3. **Smoking** – History of smoking  
4. **AlcoholDrinking** – Habit of heavy drinking  
5. **Stroke** – Whether the person ever had a stroke  
6. **PhysicalHealth** – Number of physically unhealthy days in past 30 days  
7. **MentalHealth** – Number of mentally unhealthy days in past 30 days  
8. **DiffWalking** – Difficulty in walking or climbing stairs  
9. **Sex** – Gender  
10. **AgeCategory** – Age grouped in categories  
11. **Race** – Ethnicity  
12. **Diabetic** – Diabetes diagnosis  
13. **PhysicalActivity** – Physical activity in past 30 days  
14. **GenHealth** – General health rating  
15. **SleepTime** – Average hours of sleep per day  
16. **Asthma** – Whether the person had asthma  
17. **KidneyDisease** – Chronic kidney disease history  
18. **SkinCancer** – Skin cancer diagnosis

## ⚙️ Models Used

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Tuned to improve accuracy  
2. **Logistic Regression** – For binary classification  
3. **Decision Tree** – Simple yet interpretable model  
4. **Random Forest** – Ensemble model for better generalization

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing Steps

- **Missing Value Handling** – Cleaned and filtered rows  
- **Categorical Encoding** – Used Label Encoder & OneHotEncoder  
- **Feature Scaling** – StandardScaler for normalization  
- **Formatting** – Ensured consistent types and values

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was assessed using multiple performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **ROC Curve**
- **AUC Score**
- **Cohen’s Kappa Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

---

## 📊 Visualizations

The project includes plots for:

- **ROC Curves**
- **Confusion Matrices**
- **Model Comparisons (bar charts or metrics)**

These help in interpreting each model’s strengths and weaknesses.

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can aid in **early detection of heart disease** using health and lifestyle data. By comparing multiple models with robust evaluation, it identifies patterns that could contribute to **risk prediction and prevention**.
